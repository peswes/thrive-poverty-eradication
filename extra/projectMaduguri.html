      </a>

      <p class="article-text">
        <p>
            In response to the devastating floods that struck Maiduguri on September 9th, 2024, Thrive Poverty Eradication Initiative Foundation took immediate action to support the affected communities. The floods displaced hundreds of families, destroyed homes, and disrupted daily life in unimaginable ways.
            Our team mobilized by Muhammad Bamala(North East Condinator)  quickly to provide essential aid, including food supplies, clean water, . We also partnered with local authorities and volunteers to ensure timely and effective distribution of relief materials.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            The resilience and unity shown by the people of Maiduguri during this crisis have been truly inspiring. We remain committed to standing by these communities, not only in moments of crisis but also in their long-term recovery and rebuilding efforts.
        </p>   
        <p>
            We extend our deepest gratitude to our donors, volunteers, and partners who made this swift response possible. Together, we can help these communities rise stronger.
