       <p> At Thrive Poverty Eradication Initiative Foundation we want people to understand that, by speaking out, they can create a real impact. The people we assist, the volunteers who invest their time, and the partners who support our view are the ones who are central to all of us as an organization. In their narratives, we see direction, movement, and sufficient zeal to continue making a difference </p>

        We invite you to join our growing community, share your story, and help amplify the voices that drive positive change. Share your story on our email address below:
