      <p> At Thrive Poverty Eradication Initiative Foundation, equity is not only an ideal, it’s our belief in justice, equality, and opportunity. Equity gives everybody equal access to the same resources, but equity acknowledges that not everyone starts at the same place. It involves recognising the institutional constraints that keep some communities in the dark, and intentionally eliminating them</p>

        </p>Equity is not merely about distribution; it’s also about redistribution of authority, access and opportunity. It’s about bringing historically underrepresented voices into the solutions we build.</p>
        
        <p>We think a just world is one in which everyone has the support and the ability to thrive, not because they are poor, but because we take an active part in their challenges. Our work is based on the belief that we uplift everyone when we lift those who have been held back.</p>

        <p>
            Fairness demands that we listen, teach and move. It requires us to face hard realities, confront systemic injustices and collaborate with the communities we serve. It’s a process that requires compassion, fortitude and a relentless pursuit of justice.
