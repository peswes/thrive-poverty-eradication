      </a>

      <p class="article-text">
       <p>
        The recent flood disaster in Maiduguri on September 9, 2024, has left a lasting impact on the lives of many, including the children and staff of Asikira Primary School. The floodwaters not only displaced families and destroyed homes, but they also severely damaged essential infrastructure, including schools that serve as pillars of education and hope for the community.
       </p> 

<P>
    In the wake of this devastating event, Thrive Poverty Eradication Initiative Foundation is stepping in to rebuild and restore Asikira Primary School. Our mission is clear: to ensure that no child’s education is halted by this tragedy, and that hope is rekindled through swift and compassionate action.
</P>
        
<P>
    Impact of the Floods on Asikira Primary School
    The floodwaters inundated classrooms, destroyed teaching materials, and made the school premises unsafe. Students who once filled these classrooms with curiosity and learning were left with uncertainty and distress. Many families have been displaced, and the educational future of these children hangs in the balance.
</P>
