            Hon. Chief Amb. Billy Umar Garba: 
        A Visionary, Entrepreneur, Politician, Ambassador Humanitarian and Philanthropist*
        <p>
            Amb. Billy Umar Garba is a distinguished entrepreneur and humanitarian, renowned for her exceptional business acumen and dedication to eradicating poverty in Africa/Globally through her humanitarian and philanthropist work all over the world with focus on Africa. 
            <p>
                Amb. Billy Umar Garba uses her blessings as a dual citizenship of United States Of America to spreed her humanitarian philosophies work across countries. I live by 1 John 3:17-18 But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him? Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.
